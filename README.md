#IN CONSTRUCTION ðŸ˜œ

I am trying to build a portfolio website to showcase my work. 
My plan is to make a simple and easy-to-navigate website.

I will try to keep the code clean and organized, something that did not happen in any of my study projects. ðŸ˜“

The plan is a website with two or three sections on the same page, I will use react-scroll. 
I want to put a shortcut menu for the different sections. 
A navbar always visible, and maybe a button to send a message directly. 
A section with my projects arranged in cards, which allows me to easily add new projects...
